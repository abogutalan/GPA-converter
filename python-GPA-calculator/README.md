> Implement a test suite that evaluates the percentage grade to grade letter conversion within the library. Your suites should evaluate the highest,lowest and midrange value for each letter grade the system supports(A through F).

# GPA Calculator Python Testsuite

This directory contains the GPA calculator library within the subdirectory
`gpa_calculator` as well as all of the tools required to run the test suite.


# How to run

Run the test suite using this command:

	python3 runtests.py


# Test Status

This section lists each test in the suite, and its current status (PASS or FAIL)
